       <div id="para">Hello, I hope you are enjoying my project! As you can see, I tried to visualize Kim In Yook's beautiful poem (and my favorite one), "Physics of Love." Some of you might know it from a Goblin, the k-drama. The lines appear on each slide, and in the background, I used the elements of each mini project we have done in this class to illustrate the poem. For example, in the backdrop of the second slide, the floating circles refer to our sixth mini project - Object dancers. The lines on this slide, "A girl as small as a violet, A grill who moves like a flower petal," explain the slowly moving petal-colored circles and one smaller red circle. There is some interactive part too. Make sure you didn't miss it. And if you want to listen to the poem in Korean, I shared the link <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlx1xmDBR1Q">here.</a> Enjoy!</div>
